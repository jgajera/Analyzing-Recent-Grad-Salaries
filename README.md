# Analyzing-Recent-Grad-Salaries

### Introduction
We'll work with a dataset of college majors and their post-graduate employment information. We'll explore the data with the pandas plotting functionality in Jupyter.

### Goals
We might explore some questions like:
- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
  - Using scatter plots
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
  - Using histograms
- Which category of majors have the most students?
  - Using bar plots

### Given: Data Set
The dataset was originally compiled by the American Community Survey, and Github user FiveThirtyEight cleaned it and released it to their [Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).
